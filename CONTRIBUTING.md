Feel free to fork and then create a pull request! But be sure to match following things:
- Tests and whole pipeline on CircleCI should pass
- New tests should be written to cover your changes

There might be instances I will refuse new functionalities, and this is not your fault! I have a general idea what this package should do and should not do, at times I will keep on this idea.
